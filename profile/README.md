Employers can now leverage the power of the blockchain to making the on/offboarding process more efficient, reliable, and safer. This can be done using lighting fast documentation thorugh the ability to use a persons private keys for signatures and multisig wallets. Then we can associate the documents to an address and maintain activity on the paperwork along the documents as well. 

The future of this organization is to build enterprise level software to introduce blockchain into all facets of corporate documentation.

## Use the power and efficiency of blockchains to supercharge the workplace.

🖥️ Access to your important documents can be from any desktop with the ultimate privacy and security (your own private keys).

🖨️ Go PAPERLESS, reduce your companies paper trail to the max by digitalizing your record system.

🛠️ Troubleshooting issues can be handled within your existing IT department with additional training.

😓 Frustrated? You can find anything you need with prebuilt queries to your companies blockchain.
